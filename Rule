Perfect, now I’m fully aligned 👍
You want a scalable, practical “how exactly to do it” for Steps 1–6, explicitly showing where LLMs help, because ~300 checklist points is too big to do naively.

Below is a repeatable, semi-automated workflow that real teams use.

I’ll go step by step and for each step I’ll say:
	•	What is manual
	•	What is LLM-assisted
	•	What is automated
	•	What artifacts you produce

No skipping. No magic.

⸻

STEP 1 — MERGE 6 EXCEL CHECKLISTS (SCALE-SAFE)

Goal

Create a single source of truth without losing provenance.

⸻

WHAT YOU DO (Manual + Scripted)
	1.	Keep original 6 Excel files untouched
	2.	Write a small script (or Excel PowerQuery) to merge them

Required columns (non-negotiable)

Column	Who fills	How
checklist_id	Script	Prefix + running number
checklist_text	Original	Copied as-is
source_checklist	Script	File name
product_type	Script	From source
version	Script	v1

📌 This step is 100% mechanical
🚫 No LLM needed here

⸻

Output

👉 master_checklist.csv (~300 rows)

⸻

STEP 2 — INTENT TYPE TAGGING (LLM-ASSISTED, HUMAN-APPROVED)

This is where scale matters.

⸻

WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING

You’re answering:

“What kind of check is this?”

You only allow 7 intent types.

⸻

HOW TO DO IT AT SCALE (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

2.1 Define a FIXED intent taxonomy (once)

existence
numeric
geometric
consistency
annotation
manufacturability
compliance

Freeze this list.

⸻

2.2 Use LLM for first-pass tagging

LLM Prompt (batch-friendly)

You are classifying engineering checklist items.

Choose ONE intent type from:
[existence, numeric, geometric, consistency, annotation, manufacturability, compliance]

Checklist item:
"Dimensions should not clash with each other and also with views"

Return ONLY the intent type.

LLM Output

geometric


⸻

2.3 Human review (fast)
	•	Engineer reviews 300 rows
	•	Corrects only mismatches (usually <10%)

💡 This reduces effort from 300 decisions → ~30 corrections

⸻

Output

intent_type column finalized

⸻

STEP 3 — ATOMIC RULE DECOMPOSITION (LLM-ASSISTED, HUMAN-CONTROLLED)

This is the most cognitively expensive step, so LLM helps a LOT.

⸻

WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING

Turning vague human checks into binary machine checks.

⸻

3.1 LLM proposes atomic splits

LLM Prompt

You are converting engineering checklist items into atomic checks.

Checklist:
"Ensure views and dimensions should not clash with each other"

Rules:
- Each atomic check must result in YES or NO
- Do not include solutions
- Do not include assumptions

Return a numbered list of atomic checks.

LLM Output

1. Dimensions do not overlap with other dimensions
2. Dimensions do not overlap with drawing views


⸻

3.2 Human validates & edits

You only check:
	•	Are they binary?
	•	Are they independent?
	•	Are they checkable with data?

Reject or merge if needed.

⸻

3.3 Assign atomic_rule_id

atomic_rule_id	parent_checklist_id	atomic_description
DIM_01A	G_07	Dimension vs dimension overlap
DIM_01B	G_07	Dimension vs view overlap

📌 Expect:
	•	300 checklist points → ~500–700 atomic rules
	•	This is normal

⸻

Output

atomic_rules.csv

⸻

STEP 4 — REQUIRED INPUT DATA IDENTIFICATION (LLM SUGGESTS, YOU DECIDE)

This step determines what can be automated vs manual.

⸻

WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING

Answering:

“What data must exist for this rule to be checkable?”

⸻

4.1 Create a controlled vocabulary of data fields

Example:

dimension_bbox
view_bbox
section_views
bom_part_no
drawing_part_no
hole_diameter
welding_symbols
material_spec

Freeze this list.

⸻

4.2 LLM suggests required inputs

LLM Prompt

Given this atomic check:
"Dimension vs view overlap"

Choose required inputs ONLY from this list:
[dimension_bbox, view_bbox, section_views, bom_part_no, drawing_part_no]

Return a comma-separated list.

LLM Output

dimension_bbox, view_bbox


⸻

4.3 Human sanity check

You verify:
	•	No missing data
	•	No unnecessary data

⸻

4.4 Add checkability flag

atomic_rule_id	required_inputs	checkability
DIM_01B	dimension_bbox, view_bbox	auto
STR_05	stress_value	manual
LAW_01	mv_act_clause	manual


⸻

Output

Atomic rules now know what data they need.

⸻

STEP 5 — APPLICABILITY MAPPING (LLM CAN PRE-FILL)

This is where you solve the 6 checklist overlap problem cleanly.

⸻

WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING

Answering:

“Where does this rule make sense?”

⸻

5.1 Product types (fixed list)

general
bus_body_structure
bus_body_trims
bus_body_scf
bus_body_cws
electrical


⸻

5.2 LLM suggests applicability

LLM Prompt

Atomic rule:
"Welding symbol must be present at joint"

Which product types does this apply to?
Choose from:
[general, bus_body_structure, bus_body_trims, bus_body_scf, bus_body_cws, electrical]

LLM Output

bus_body_structure, bus_body_scf, bus_body_cws


⸻

5.3 Human validation

Engineer quickly checks yes/no per column.

⸻

Output

Applicability matrix ready

⸻

STEP 6 — DEFINE PASS / FAIL LOGIC (HUMAN + TEMPLATE)

This step must be deterministic.

⸻

WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING

Writing logic a computer can evaluate without interpretation.

⸻

6.1 Use logic templates (IMPORTANT)

Create templates per intent type.

Existence

pass: count(X) >= N
fail: count(X) < N

Geometric

pass: intersection(A, B) == Ø
fail: intersection(A, B) ≠ Ø

Consistency

pass: A == B
fail: A != B

Numeric

pass: X ∈ [min, max]
fail: X ∉ [min, max]


⸻

6.2 Fill template per atomic rule

atomic_rule_id	pass_condition	fail_condition
DIM_01B	intersection(dimension_bbox, view_bbox)==Ø	≠Ø
BOM_02	bom.part_no==drawing.part_no	!=

🚫 NO LLM here
This is engineering logic.

⸻

Output

Your rule engine is now fully definable.

⸻

🧠 WHAT LLM IS USED FOR (CLEAR BOUNDARY)

Step	LLM Role
Step 2	Intent tagging
Step 3	Atomic rule suggestion
Step 4	Required data suggestion
Step 5	Applicability pre-fill
Step 6	❌ No

LLM never:
	•	Decides YES/NO
	•	Interprets geometry
	•	Executes logic

⸻

✅ WHAT YOU HAVE AFTER STEP 6

You now possess:

✔ A 300-point checklist systematized
✔ ~600 atomic rules
✔ Clear automation boundaries
✔ Deterministic logic
✔ LLM only where it scales cognition

This is exactly how you scale without losing control.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Walk one real checklist point end-to-end
	•	Give exact LLM prompt templates
	•	Help you estimate automation coverage
	•	Help you prioritize which 100 rules to implement first

Just tell me the next move.
